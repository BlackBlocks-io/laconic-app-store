# Laconic App Store

The Laconic App Store is a web application that allows users to browse and manage application deployment records. This project uses React, Apollo Client, and GraphQL to interact with a backend service and display the data in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **List of Applications:** View a searchable list of application deployment records.
- **Application Details:** Click on any application to see more detailed information.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Apollo Client:** A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.
